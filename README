NAME
    Data::Dump::Streamer - Perl extension for breadth first accurate dumping of
    data structures in perl code form.

SYNOPSIS
      use Data::Dump::Streamer;

      Dump($x,$y);                       # Prints to STDOUT
      Dump($x,$y)->Out();                #   "          "

      my $s=Dump($x,$y);                 # Returns a string
      my $s=Dump($x,$y)->Out();          #    "         "

      my @l=Dump($x,$y);                 # List of code fragments
      my @l=Dump($x,$y)->Out();          # List of code fragments

      my $o=Data::Dump::Streamer->new(); # New Data::Dump::Streamer obj
      my $o=Dump();                      # same;

      Dump($x,$y)->To(\*STDERR)->Out();  # Prints to STDERR

      Dump($x,$y)->Names('foo','bar')
                 ->Out();                # Specify Names

      Dump($x,$y)->Indent(0)->Out();     # No indent

      Dump($x,$y)->To(\*STDERR)          # Output to STDERR
                 ->Indent(0)             # ... no indent
                 ->Names('foo','bar')    # ... specify Names
                 ->Out();                # Print...

      $o->Data($x,$y);                   # Object form
      $o->Names('Foo','Names');          #  ...
      $o->Out();                         #  ...

INSTALLATION
    To install this module type the following:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    On Win32 systems change make to nmake or dmake as appropriate.

    The modules requires a functional C compiler, however PPM support
    for Win32 users will also be available sometime soon.

    It is known to work correctly on Perl 5.6 and later on both Win32
    and *nix operating systems.

DEPENDENCIES
    This module requires these other modules and libraries:

      Text::Balanced
      Test::More

    and optionally for enhanced testing

      Algortihm::Diff

    All other dependencies are part of the standard distribution as
    of Perl 5.6.
