1.0

Release version. Name changed to Data::Dump::Streamer which will be future name.

1.01

Post-release minor fix to provide SortKeys and Hashkeys aliases to SortKeys
and HashKeys. Thanks to Slaven Rezic for the heads up. Added documentation
improvements and fixes as well as a very slight and subtle change to the
behaviour of Dump() in list context.

1.02

Changed test 14 of dump.t, added a few tests, and some support code for
future enhancements, and most notably support for deparsing formats. Thanks
to Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes for the latter.
