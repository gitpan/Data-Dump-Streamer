1.0

Release version. Name changed to Data::Dump::Streamer which will be
future name.

1.01

Post-release minor fix to provide SortKeys and Hashkeys aliases to
both SortKeys and HashKeys. Thanks to Slaven Rezic for the heads up.
Added documentation improvements and fixes as well as a very slight
and subtle change to the behaviour of Dump() in list context.

1.02

Changed test 14 of dump.t, added a few tests, and some support code
for future enhancements, and most notably support for deparsing
formats. Thanks to Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes for the latter.

1.03, 1.04

Enhanced format support for FORMAT refs. Yitzchak pointed out some
bugs in the original handling. DeparseFormat() has been removed. It
should never have existed in the first place. DeparseGlob() was the
correct method/attribute to use. FormatStub() attribute added.

This release I'm introducing some new testing code that im trying out.
Once im happy with it I intend to convert all my old tests to use it
and do away with the really quite horrible same() and _same() in
test_helper.pl.
